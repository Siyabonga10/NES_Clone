# NES Emulator

Welcome to the NES Emulator project! This is a work-in-progress emulator for the classic Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), designed to faithfully replicate the behavior of the original hardware. The project is written in C# and aims to provide an accurate and efficient emulation experience.

## Features

### Implemented Functionality
- **CPU Emulation**: The 6502 CPU has been fully implemented and rigorously tested to ensure accurate instruction decoding and execution.
- **Memory Management**: Support for cartridge memory mapping, including basic mapper functionality (Mapper 000).
- **PPU (Partial)**: Initial implementation of the Picture Processing Unit (PPU), including basic VRAM handling and background tile rendering.
- **System Clock**: A synchronized clock system to coordinate CPU and PPU operations.
- **Test ROM Support**: Successfully runs test ROMs to validate CPU functionality.

### Outstanding Features
- **Graphics**: Full implementation of the PPU, including sprite rendering, scrolling, and palette management.
- **Audio**: Emulation of the NES APU (Audio Processing Unit) to replicate authentic sound output.
- **Advanced Mappers**: Support for additional cartridge mappers to enable compatibility with a wider range of games.
- **User Interface**: A polished graphical interface for loading ROMs and controlling the emulator.

## About the Project

This emulator is a personal project aimed at deepening my understanding of low-level systems programming, computer architecture, and the challenges of hardware emulation. It showcases my ability to design and implement complex systems while adhering to clean and maintainable coding practices.

Feel free to explore the codebase and follow the progress of this project. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
